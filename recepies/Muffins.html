    <h1> British muffins!</h1>
    <h3>  Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of plain flour</li>
        <li>1 cup of water </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>  How to do it:</h3>


    <ol> 
        <li> Mix the Ingredients: In a bowl, mix together 1 cup of plain flour, 1 cup of water, and 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise until you get a lumpy, runny batter.
        </li>
        <li> Spoon into Muffin Tin: Pour the batter into a muffin tin, filling each cup halfway. Don't worry about greasing the tinâ€”these muffins are sticky enough!
        </li>
        <li>Bake at a Random Temperature: Set your oven to whatever temperature you feel like (250Â°F or 450Â°F, it doesnâ€™t matter) 
            and bake the muffins until theyâ€™re dry on the outside but still gooey on the inside.
        </li>
        
        <li>Serve Cold: Let the muffins cool completely (or not) and serve them at room temperature. Enjoy your bland, sticky creation!
        </li>
    </ol>
