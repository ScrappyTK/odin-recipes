        <li> Boil the Water:

            Pour 4 cups of water into a pot.
            Place the pot on the stove and turn the heat to high.
            Bring the water to a rolling boil. Youâ€™ll see bubbles rising quickly from the bottom of the pot.

        <li> Add Salt and Pepper:

            Once the water is boiling, add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
            Add 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper.
            Stir well to make sure the salt and pepper are evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>Simmer:

            Let the water continue to boil for about 1-2 minutes to ensure the soup is piping hot and the salt and pepper are fully dissolved.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Serve:

            Carefully pour the steaming hot soup into a bowl.
