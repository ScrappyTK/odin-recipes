    <h1> Taco the latino waffels</h1>
    <h3>  Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 stale corn tortilla</li>
        <li>1 slice of processed cheese </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>  How to do it:</h3>


    <ol> 
        <li> Warm the Tortilla: Heat the stale corn tortilla in a pan for about 10 seconds on each side, just enough to make it slightly bendable (but not enough to freshen it up).
        </li>
        <li> Add the Cheese: Place the slice of processed cheese onto the tortilla. Don't bother melting it, just slap it on cold.
        </li>
        <li>Top with Ketchup: Drizzle a tablespoon of ketchup right on top of the cheese. No need to spread it evenlyâ€”let it pool in one spot.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Fold and Serve: Fold the tortilla in half, and serve immediately (or leave it out for a few hours to get extra chewy).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Enjoy your meal</h3>
